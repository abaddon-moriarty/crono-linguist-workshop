**A Django Learning Project in Active Development**

The Chrono-Linguist's Workshop is a web application built with Django designed to perform linguistic and stylistic analysis on text corpora. It allows users to upload texts, organize them into dossiers, and analyze features like word frequency, sentiment, and syntax across different authors, eras, and genres.

This project is primarily a **hands-on exercise** for me to learn and practice full-stack web development with Django, natural language processing (NLP), and software architecture. It is not a production-ready application.

## Project Status: Phase 1 (MVP) - In Progress

This project is being developed in phased milestones. The current goal is to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

*   **Phase 0 (Complete):** Project setup, basic Django configuration.
*   **Phase 1 (In Progress):** MVP - Basic text upload and word frequency analysis.
*   **Phase 2 (Planned):** Beta - Enhanced analysis (sentiment, sentence length), improved UI, Dossier system.
*   **Phase 3 (Planned):** V1.0 - Data visualizations (Chart.js), built-in text library.
*   **Phase 4 (Future):** V2.0+ - Advanced features (topic modeling, cross-text comparison, user auth).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack (Planned/In Use)

*   **Backend:** Python, Django
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Bulma/Picnic planned), JavaScript (Chart.js planned)
*   **NLP Libraries:** NLTK, TextBlob
*   **Database:** SQLite (Development), PostgreSQL (Potential future deployment)

## Learning Objectives

This project is a sandbox for exploring:
*   The Django framework (Models, Views, Templates, Forms, ORM).
*   Integrating NLP functionalities into a web application.
*   Building interactive data visualizations for the web.
*   Software project organization and version control with Git.
*   Incremental development and feature planning.

## Note for Visitors

Please keep in mind that this is a **project in progress**.
*   You will encounter incomplete features, bugs, and changing architectures.
*   Code may not be optimized or follow all best practices *yet* as I experiment and learn.
*   The `main` branch should be stable, but check the `dev` branch for the latest work-in-progress.

## Contributing & Feedback

As this is a personal learning exercise, I am not actively seeking code contributions. However, I am very open to:
*   **Constructive feedback** on code structure or Django patterns.
*   **Suggestions** for features or learning resources.
*   **Interesting ideas** for linguistic analysis to implement.

Please feel free to open an issue to start a discussion!
